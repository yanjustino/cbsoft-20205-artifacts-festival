# CBSoft 2025 Artifacts Festival

## Overview

The CBSoft 2025 Artifacts Festival introduces an Artifact Evaluation Committee and artifact badging for the first time. This initiative promotes Open Science in Software Engineering research, rewards authors who share their artifacts, and helps readers identify papers with available and functional artifacts.

Artifacts are materials or products associated with research papers, ranging from data repositories to fully automated tools. These artifacts enable transparency, replication, validation, and reuse of research findings.

## Artifact Directories

### GCS (Granularity Classification Spectrum)

The `gcs` directory contains artifacts related to the Capability Granularity Mapping Questionnaire. These artifacts are designed to:
- Facilitate the identification and classification of software capabilities.
- Provide a systematic inventory of implementation units.
- Map implementation units to deployables and analyze their distribution across GCS levels.
- Highlight heterogeneity hotspots and identify risks.
- Suggest actionable steps for improvement.

Refer to the [`gcs/README.md`](./gcs/README.md) file for detailed instructions on using these artifacts.

### GSI (Granularity Saturation Index)

The `gsi` directory contains artifacts focused on metrics and analysis tools for evaluating granularity saturation. These include:
- Data files such as `metrics.csv` for statistical analysis.
- Python scripts in the `src` folder for processing and visualizing granularity metrics.
- Core modules for elasticity, variation, and weight calculations.

Refer to the [`gsi/README.md`](./gsi/README.md) file for detailed instructions on using these artifacts.

## Artifact Badging

Artifacts can earn two types of badges:
- **Available**: The artifact is publicly accessible, properly documented, and placed in a persistent repository with a DOI.
- **Functional**: The artifact is complete, exercisable, and properly documented to enable execution.
