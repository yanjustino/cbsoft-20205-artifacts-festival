# CBSoft 2025 Artifacts Festival

## Overview

The CBSoft 2025 Artifacts Festival introduces an Artifact Evaluation Committee and artifact badging for the first time. This initiative promotes Open Science in Software Engineering research, rewards authors who share their artifacts, and helps readers identify papers with available and functional artifacts.

Artifacts are materials or products associated with research papers, ranging from data repositories to fully automated tools. These artifacts enable transparency, replication, validation, and reuse of research findings.

## Artifact Directories
These artifacts supports the Capability Granularity Mapping Questionnaire and Granularity Saturation Index analysis. It provides tools and templates for evaluating software capabilities, mapping implementation units, and analyzing granularity metrics.


### Artifact 01 - Granularity Classification Spectrum (GCS)

The `gcs` directory contains artifacts related to the Capability Granularity Mapping Questionnaire. These artifacts are designed to:
- Facilitate the identification and classification of software capabilities.
- Provide a systematic inventory of implementation units.
- Map implementation units to deployables and analyze their distribution across GCS levels.
- Highlight heterogeneity hotspots and identify risks.
- Suggest actionable steps for improvement.

Refer to the [`gcs/README.md`](./gcs/README.md) file for detailed instructions on using these artifacts.

### Artifact 02 - Granularity Saturation Index (GSI)

The `gsi` directory contains artifacts focused on metrics and analysis tools for evaluating granularity saturation. These include:
- Data files such as `metrics.csv` for statistical analysis.
- Python scripts in the `src` folder for processing and visualizing granularity metrics.
- Core modules for elasticity, variation, and weight calculations.

Refer to the [`gsi/README.md`](./gsi/README.md) file for detailed instructions on using these artifacts.

## Artifact Badging

- **Functional**: The artifact is complete, exercisable, and properly documented to enable execution.


## Required Skills:

- Familiarity with Python programming.
- Basic knowledge of software engineering concepts, including granularity classification and metrics analysis.
- Experience with Git for repository management.
## Required Resources:

- RAM: Minimum 4GB.
- Disk Space: At least 500MB for data files and dependencies.
- Packages: Python 3.10+ with required libraries listed in requirements.txt.
- Operating System: macOS, Linux, or Windows.
- Additional Tools: Git for cloning the repository.
