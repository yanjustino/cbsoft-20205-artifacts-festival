# CBSoft 2025 Artifacts Festival

## Overview

The CBSoft 2025 Artifacts Festival introduces an Artifact Evaluation Committee and artifact badging for the first time. This initiative promotes Open Science in Software Engineering research, rewards authors who share their artifacts, and helps readers identify papers with available and functional artifacts.

Artifacts are materials or products associated with research papers, ranging from data repositories to fully automated tools. These artifacts enable transparency, replication, validation, and reuse of research findings.

## Artifact Types

Artifacts of interest include:
- **Data repositories**: Data used for or produced through the study.
- **Tools and frameworks**: Implementations of systems and services.
- **Qualitative artifacts**: Interview scripts, survey templates, transcripts, and results.
- **Machine learning models**: Pre-trained models for software engineering problems.
- **Replication packages**: A mix of the above, depending on the research type.

## Artifact Badging

Artifacts can earn two types of badges:
- **Available**: The artifact is publicly accessible, properly documented, and placed in a persistent repository with a DOI.
- **Functional**: The artifact is complete, exercisable, and properly documented to enable execution.

## Submission Instructions

Authors of papers accepted to SBES, SAST, SBCARS, and SBLP 2025 can submit artifacts for evaluation. The repository must include:
- A LICENSE file describing distribution rights.
- A README file explaining the artifact and repository organization.

### README Requirements
The README file must:
- Describe the artifact and repository structure.
- Include a link to the accepted paper.
- Cover storage requirements and ethical/legal statements (for data-focused artifacts).
- Provide installation and execution instructions (for code-focused artifacts).

### Persistent Storage
Artifacts must be placed in publicly accessible archival repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Open Science Framework) to qualify for the "Available" badge.

## Important Dates

### Cycle 1 (SBES tracks only):
- **Artifact submission deadline**: July 16, 2025
- **Author notification**: August 8, 2025

### Cycle 2 (SAST, SBCARS, SBLP):
- **Artifact submission deadline**: August 6, 2025
- **Author notification**: August 23, 2025
